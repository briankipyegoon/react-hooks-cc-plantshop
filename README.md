## Project Overview

**Plantsy** is a React-based web app that interacts with a backend API to manage plant data. It allows users to:

- View a list of all plants.
- Add new plants to the inventory.
- Mark plants as sold out.
- Search plants by their name.
- Update plant prices.
- Remove plants from the inventory.

The app uses **React** for the frontend and a JSON server to manage backend operations.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/briankipyegoon/react-hooks-cc-plantshop.git
cd react-hooks-cc-plantshop
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Use this command to install all necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Start the JSON Server

Launch the backend JSON server to manage API requests. It will run at `http://localhost:6001`.

```bash
npm run server
```

You can visit `http://localhost:6001/plants` to check that the backend is running correctly.

### 4. Start the React App

In a new terminal window, run the following to start the app:

```bash
npm start
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

### 5. Access the App

Go to `http://localhost:3000` in your browser to view the application.

## Features

### Core Features

1. **View All Plants**: The app displays all plants loaded from the backend when it starts.
2. **Add a New Plant**: Users can add a new plant to the catalog using a form. The new plant is instantly added to the list and saved to the backend.
3. **Mark as Sold Out**: Users can toggle the availability status of a plant between "In Stock" and "Out of Stock."
4. **Search for Plants**: The search bar allows users to filter plants by name, updating the displayed list in real-time.

### Advanced Features

1. **Update Plant Price**: Users can edit the price of a plant from the plant card, and the change will be saved to the backend.
2. **Delete a Plant**: Users can remove plants from the inventory, which will also delete them from the backend.

## Usage

### Add a Plant

To add a plant, fill out the "Plant Name", "Image URL", and "Price" fields in the form at the top, then click **Add Plant**. The plant will appear in the list.

### Search for Plants

Type part of a plant's name in the search bar to filter the list. The results will update dynamically as you type.

### Update Plant Price

To change a plantâ€™s price, enter the new amount in the price field on the plant card and click **Update Price** to save the change. This update will be reflected in the backend.

### Mark a Plant as Sold Out

Each plant card has an **In Stock** button. Clicking this toggles the plantâ€™s availability status between "In Stock" and "Out of Stock."

### Delete a Plant

Click the **Delete** button on a plant card to remove that plant from both the inventory list and the backend.
